To generalize this to more parties, the time to complete the full transaction is proportional to the number of people that participate. We would need each party to know the next party they need to swap with and give them the key. That party would then contact the next in the loop etc. Eventually, after the last party recieves the secret from the second-to-last, the loop closes and all parties are able to retrieve their currency.
So, this sequence of actions would have to be carried out n times in a ring topology (since each party is connected to two others). Therefore, the total time needed to finish an exchange of n parties, wherein each party can trustlessly swap their assets one hop in the same direction in a ring topology, would be 4nâˆ† time units. This assumes all block times are the same.
